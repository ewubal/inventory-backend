# inventory-backend

1. There is inventory/src/main/resources/import.sql file, where are all the database tables for this application,
 so firstly you have to configure a database and then run that file.
2. And then run InventoryApplication.
3. There is also front-end repository, where you also have to npm start, and the application should be working.

- I used Spring Boot for the back-end and React for the front-end.
- In this application you can register an account, login, add repositories and items, modify and delete items.
- There is also search bar which returns all your items, that contain the search word.
- Couldn't finish ADMIN view in front-end, so that part is missing.
- Back-end is also missing unit tests
